# ðŸš€ BuildIn15 â€“ with Deep

**BuildIn15 â€“ with Deep** is a developer-focused initiative where I explore one tech topic every 15 days through practical, hands-on learning.

This repository contains concise, structured content designed to help developers, students, and curious learners sharpen their skills â€” one day at a time.

Each 15-day sprint is crafted to be simple, focused, and directly useful in real-world development.

Stay consistent. Build daily. Grow endlessly.

Letâ€™s code the future, one commit at a time. ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
